    <p class="text-anecdotes">The Spider-Man actor failed to hold his tongue about Spider-Man: Homecoming, revealing too much to the public. Disney then did not allow him to read the Avengers: Infinity War script as a punishment. He told the Toronto Sun, "I do not know anything about the movie, I know who the villain is, and that's about it, they do not let me read anything because I can not keep a secret. ". Hope he will keep the mysteries of production for next time!</p>
